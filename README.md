# Image Filters
This project creates filters, such as pixellate, invert, rotate, etc. that alter images. 
Code was implemented in a6filter.py and a6image.py by me. Specifications and other included files were provided by Walker White and Dexter Kozen where specifed. 
To run the application, type "python imager" into the command line (quotes not included). This will use the default photo - a profile of Walker White.
Other images can be used by entering "python imager myimage.png" where myimage.png is the desired image. Some images that may be used are provided in the samples folder.
Typing "python imager --test" will run test cases (provided in a6test.py) on the classes Image and Filter in that order.
This project uses the introcs packages found here: https://github.com/WalkerWhite/introcs-python.
